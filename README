Intro:
Something I hobbled together by staring at incomplete examples. In my opinion there is not enough good
examples for Scala build environments yet. Here is the result. Took me 15 hours but thats ok. now I have a
base for other projects I want to create. 
(at some point ill get arround to porting the maven archetype default for the lift framework)

Requirements:
ant 1.6.2+
jdk 1.4+

Ivy will be downloaded automaticly so it does not need to be installed
This template can easly be imported into NetBeans (the nbproject folder)
Run project: 
	ant run

build jar: 
	ant jar

run the ScalaTest tests: 
	ant test

Uses Ivy 2.1.0

The only required files in the project:
build.xml
ivy.xml
ivysettings.xml

all other folders will be generated when build.xml is run
